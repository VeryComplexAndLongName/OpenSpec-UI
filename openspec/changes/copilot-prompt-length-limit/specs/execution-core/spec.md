## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: The Copilot CLI adapter degrades gracefully for an oversized prompt

Because `copilot -p` delivers the prompt only as a positional CLI
argument (no stdin path), the `copilot-cli` adapter SHALL fall back to a
short prompt naming the change's `changeDir` and instructing the agent to
read its artifact files itself, rather than embedding the full content
inline, whenever the full embedded prompt would exceed a safety margin
under the operating system's command-line length limit. Below that
threshold, the adapter SHALL embed the full content as normal.

#### Scenario: A prompt under the threshold embeds full content

- **WHEN** a `plan`/`review`/`implement` run's constructed prompt for
  `copilot-cli` is under the length threshold
- **THEN** the spawned process receives the full embedded artifact
  content as its positional prompt argument, unchanged from today

#### Scenario: A prompt over the threshold falls back to a path-pointing prompt

- **WHEN** a run's constructed prompt for `copilot-cli` exceeds the
  length threshold
- **THEN** the spawned process instead receives a short prompt naming the
  change's directory and instructing the agent to read its artifact
  files itself, and does not receive the oversized content inline
