## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Changes and Archive lists render inside a bounded, windowed scroll container

`ChangesList` and `ArchiveList` SHALL render inside a height-bounded
scroll container, independent of item count. Below a size threshold,
every item SHALL render as a real DOM row, identical to unbounded
rendering aside from the container. Above the threshold, only the
currently visible window of rows (plus a small overscan margin) SHALL
be mounted as real DOM nodes, with the full scrollable height preserved
so scrolling reveals the remaining rows correctly.

#### Scenario: A list below the threshold

- **WHEN** `ChangesList` or `ArchiveList` renders a number of items at
  or below the virtualization threshold
- **THEN** every item renders as a real DOM row inside the bounded
  scroll container

#### Scenario: A list above the threshold

- **WHEN** `ChangesList` or `ArchiveList` renders a number of items
  above the virtualization threshold
- **THEN** only the visible window of rows is mounted as real DOM
  nodes, and scrolling the container reveals further rows with correct
  content

#### Scenario: The search box stays reachable regardless of list size

- **WHEN** a list's content exceeds the bounded container's height
- **THEN** the list scrolls within its own container rather than
  pushing the search box (rendered above it) out of view
