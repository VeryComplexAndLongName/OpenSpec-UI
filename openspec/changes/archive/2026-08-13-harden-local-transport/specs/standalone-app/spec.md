## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Server is localhost-only by default

The system SHALL bind to localhost by default and SHALL authenticate every
REST API request and WebSocket connection with an ephemeral per-server token.
The system SHALL reject browser API requests whose Origin does not identify
the active server. The system SHALL NOT accept remote-interface connections
unless user configuration is intentionally changed.

#### Scenario: Server started with default configuration

- **WHEN** user launches `server` with defaults
- **THEN** server is not reachable from other machines on the network

#### Scenario: Browser uses the authenticated launch URL

- **WHEN** the standalone browser obtains the token from the launch URL fragment
- **THEN** REST and WebSocket requests are authenticated without persisting the token

#### Scenario: Untrusted website targets the local server

- **WHEN** a request has a missing token or an Origin for another site
- **THEN** the server rejects it before executing an OpenSpec operation

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Server authorizes requested workspaces

The system SHALL authorize every client-provided working directory against the
server workspace policy before reading files, writing files, or invoking
OpenSpec. External working directories SHALL remain disabled unless the server
was started with explicit external-cwd opt-in.

#### Scenario: Default server receives an external cwd

- **WHEN** an API request targets a directory outside the configured workspace
- **THEN** the server rejects the request before any filesystem or process operation

### Requirement: Server bounds untrusted transport input

The system SHALL reject REST and WebSocket messages larger than its configured
payload limit before parsing or executing them.

#### Scenario: Oversized REST body

- **WHEN** a request body exceeds the configured limit
- **THEN** the server responds with payload-too-large and performs no operation
