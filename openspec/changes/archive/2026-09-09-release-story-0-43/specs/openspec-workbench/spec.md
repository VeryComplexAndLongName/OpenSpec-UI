## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Documentation screenshots are captured from a running product

A screenshot used in this repository's documentation SHALL be captured
from the running standalone UI by an end-to-end test, not taken by hand.

A hand-taken screenshot goes stale silently: the screen changes, the
picture does not, and nothing fails. One captured by a test fails when the
element it waits for is gone, so a screen that changed is reported rather
than quietly misrepresented.

Where a surface cannot be driven this way — the editor's own menus and
quick-picks are not reachable from a browser — documentation SHALL be
written to stand without a picture of it rather than carry one nothing
checks.

#### Scenario: A screen changes under a captured screenshot

- **WHEN** a screen a documentation screenshot depends on changes
- **THEN** the capture fails on the element it can no longer find, rather
  than producing a picture of the wrong screen
