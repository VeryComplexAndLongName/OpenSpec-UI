# execution-core Specification

## Purpose
The single source of truth for product behavior: unified CLI-agent execution
protocol, execution security model, OpenSpec/git state parsing, and change
status derivation — with no HTTP or VS Code API dependency, reusable from both
the standalone server and the VS Code extension host.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Unified command and event protocol
The system SHALL expose the same command set (`plan`, `implement`, `review`,
`status`, `cancel`) and event stream (`started`, `stdout`, `stderr`,
`progress`, `completed`, `failed`, `cancelled`) regardless of which CLI agent
runs and which transport (REST/WS or message bridge) delivers results. The
system SHALL NOT contain separate execution logic implementations in protocol
consumers.

#### Scenario: Same command via different transports
- **WHEN** `implement` is started via REST/WS server and, separately, via a
  message bridge inside VS Code
- **THEN** both consumers receive an identical sequence of event kinds for the
  same real execution

### Requirement: AgentRunner abstracts specific CLI agents
The system SHALL provide one execution interface that hides differences between
specific CLI agents (Claude CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Codex CLI, Gemini CLI)
and local LLM via OpenAI-compatible API behind adapters, each translating
agent specifics into the same protocol event stream.

#### Scenario: Unexpected agent output format
- **WHEN** an adapter receives output that does not match expected format
  (for example after a CLI update)
- **THEN** the system forwards that output as `stdout` without data loss and
  without crashing the run

### Requirement: Repository contents are data, not executable instructions
The system SHALL pass repository file content (change proposals, issue text,
etc.) to agents strictly as context data. The system SHALL NOT allow this
content to influence command allowlist, execution cwd, or which command is
actually run.

#### Scenario: Change file contains an injected instruction
- **WHEN** `proposal.md` for a change contains text framed as an instruction
  to bypass constraints
- **THEN** it does not alter allowlist/cwd execution behavior and is included
  only as prompt content

### Requirement: Each run is constrained by allowlist and cwd sandbox
The system SHALL validate requested command/args against allowlist and working
directory against workspace boundaries before starting an agent process. The
system SHALL NOT start execution if validation fails.

#### Scenario: Attempted run outside workspace
- **WHEN** a run is requested with cwd outside the current workspace
- **THEN** the system rejects the run before spawn and emits `failed` with a
  reason

### Requirement: Each run is audited
The system SHALL write an audit log entry for every agent run (what ran, cwd,
resulting changes), regardless of success, failure, or cancellation.

#### Scenario: Run failed
- **WHEN** command execution ends with `failed`
- **THEN** the audit log still contains that run entry

### Requirement: Change status is derived in one place
The system SHALL compute change status (`draft`/`in-progress`/`implemented`/
`archived`) through one heuristic function based on change file location and
`tasks.md` state, without persisting status as a separate field.

#### Scenario: Change with partially completed tasks
- **WHEN** a change is under `openspec/changes/` (not `archive/`) and part of
  `tasks.md` checklist items are marked `[x]`
- **THEN** the system computes `in-progress`, not `draft` and not
  `implemented`

### Requirement: OpenSpec CLI JSON is validated at the core boundary
The system SHALL validate fields consumed by delivery adapters before returning
structured OpenSpec CLI results.

#### Scenario: CLI returns valid compatible output with additive fields
- **WHEN** a supported command returns all required fields plus unknown fields
- **THEN** core returns the result without discarding the additive fields

#### Scenario: CLI returns valid JSON with an incompatible shape
- **WHEN** a required consumed field is missing or has an incompatible type
- **THEN** core rejects the result with a typed compatibility diagnostic
- **AND** identifies the command and expected contract

#### Scenario: CLI returns malformed JSON
- **WHEN** a JSON command exits successfully but stdout is not valid JSON
- **THEN** core rejects the result with a typed invalid-JSON diagnostic

#### Scenario: Diagnostic includes CLI output
- **WHEN** core reports an output compatibility failure
- **THEN** the diagnostic includes only a bounded output preview
- **AND** does not expose unbounded child-process output

### Requirement: Best-effort git-derived change and task timestamps

The system SHALL derive, for a given OpenSpec change (active or
archived), a best-effort created date, an archived date when applicable,
and a best-effort completion date per task in `tasks.md`, without
requiring any change to how tasks are authored or checked off. Any date
that cannot be determined (shallow clone, uncommitted file, an
undeterminable blame line) SHALL be reported as absent (`null`) rather
than causing the read to fail.

#### Scenario: Tasks checked off in separate commits

- **WHEN** a change's `tasks.md` has checkboxes that were checked in
  distinct git commits
- **THEN** each checked task's reported date reflects its own commit's
  timestamp

#### Scenario: Tasks checked off in one squash commit

- **WHEN** several tasks were checked as part of a single squash-merge
  commit
- **THEN** all of those tasks report the same date (that commit's
  timestamp) — this is treated as a correct, expected result, not an
  error

#### Scenario: A task has never been checked

- **WHEN** a task's checkbox is still unchecked
- **THEN** its reported date is `null`

#### Scenario: An archived change reports its archive date

- **WHEN** the change is archived (its directory is
  `openspec/changes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<name>/`)
- **THEN** the reported archived date is parsed from that folder name,
  without any git call

#### Scenario: Git history is unavailable or insufficient

- **WHEN** the repository is a shallow clone, or a file's history cannot
  be resolved
- **THEN** the affected date(s) are reported as `null`, and the rest of
  the change's data (proposal/design/tasks/spec content, other
  determinable dates) is still returned

### Requirement: Stale-pending-task detection

The system SHALL determine, for a still-pending task, whether it has
sat untouched (per git blame on `tasks.md`) longer than a configurable
threshold, defaulting to 14 days. A task with an undeterminable
last-touched date SHALL never be flagged, and a completed task SHALL
never be flagged regardless of age.

#### Scenario: A pending task untouched past the threshold

- **WHEN** a still-pending task's last-touched date is older than the
  configured threshold
- **THEN** the system reports it as stale

#### Scenario: A pending task touched recently

- **WHEN** a still-pending task's last-touched date is within the
  configured threshold
- **THEN** the system does not report it as stale

#### Scenario: A completed task, regardless of age

- **WHEN** a task is checked off, however old its last-touched date
- **THEN** the system never reports it as stale

#### Scenario: An undeterminable last-touched date

- **WHEN** a pending task's last-touched date cannot be determined
  (e.g. blame unavailable)
- **THEN** the system does not report it as stale

### Requirement: Sprint report generation

The system SHALL generate, for a given set of changes and a date
range, a sprint summary containing each change's best-effort git
authorship, dates, task completion, and a plain-text summary, plus
aggregate statistics (total changes, tasks completed within the range,
and a per-author change count), rendered as a PDF document.

#### Scenario: Authorship for a change with a single commit

- **WHEN** authorship is determined for a change whose directory has
  exactly one commit touching it
- **THEN** that commit's author is reported as both the primary author
  and the sole contributor

#### Scenario: Authorship for a change with multiple commits by different authors

- **WHEN** authorship is determined for a change touched by commits
  from more than one author
- **THEN** the most recent commit's author is reported as the primary
  author, and every distinct author is listed among the contributors

#### Scenario: A task completed within the requested range

- **WHEN** a selected change's task was completed (per its best-effort
  date) within the requested date range
- **THEN** it counts toward that change's and the report's total
  tasks-completed-in-range figure

#### Scenario: A selected change started before the requested range

- **WHEN** a user explicitly selects a change for the report whose
  created date falls before the requested range
- **THEN** the change still appears in the report; only its
  task-completion counts are filtered by the range

#### Scenario: Authorship is undeterminable

- **WHEN** git history for a change's directory is unavailable or
  yields no commits
- **THEN** the report includes the change with no primary author or
  contributors, rather than failing to generate
