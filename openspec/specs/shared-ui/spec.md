# shared-ui Specification

## Purpose
One React component set for Changes/Archive/Specs/Tasks/AI panel that works
consistently over any transport, reused as-is in both standalone browser and
VS Code extension Webview.
## Requirements
### Requirement: Components are transport-agnostic
The system SHALL interact with `execution-core` only via the `Transport`
interface and SHALL NOT perform direct `fetch` or `postMessage` calls inside
view components. The system SHALL behave identically regardless of the
transport implementation provided at initialization.

#### Scenario: Switch transport implementation without component changes
- **WHEN** the same component tree is initialized first with `FetchTransport`
  and then with `MessageBridgeTransport`
- **THEN** components render equivalent output for equivalent data without code
  changes in the component layer

### Requirement: Change status comes from derived state, not UI logic
The system SHALL display change status
(`draft`/`in-progress`/`implemented`/`archived`) using the value computed by
`execution-core` and SHALL NOT implement status calculation logic in `webui`.

#### Scenario: Heuristic changes in execution-core
- **WHEN** change-state derivation logic changes in `execution-core`
- **THEN** `webui` display updates automatically without view-layer logic
  changes

### Requirement: Markdown editing is delegated to host when available
The system SHALL render spec/proposal markdown in read-only mode inside its
views and SHALL delegate editing to native host editor where available (VS Code
native editor in extension mode).

#### Scenario: User edits spec in VS Code extension
- **WHEN** user initiates spec-file editing in VS Code extension context
- **THEN** system opens the file in native VS Code editor, not inside Webview

### Requirement: AI panel uses one protocol independent of selected agent
The system SHALL provide one command-launch interface
(`plan`/`implement`/`review`) and one event-stream rendering approach
independent of selected CLI agent.

#### Scenario: Selected agent changes
- **WHEN** user switches selected agent from one CLI to another
- **THEN** command form and event rendering stay the same; only the underlying
  `AgentRunner` adapter changes

### Requirement: Changes and Archive lists share one search implementation

`ChangesList` and `ArchiveList` SHALL both filter their displayed changes
using the same predicate: a case-insensitive match against a change's
name or its human-readable status label. Neither component SHALL
implement its own, independently-maintained filter logic.

#### Scenario: Searching in ChangesList

- **WHEN** a query is entered into `ChangesList`'s search box
- **THEN** only changes whose name or status label matches the query are
  rendered

#### Scenario: Searching in ArchiveList matches status too

- **WHEN** a query matching a status label (not a name) is entered into
  `ArchiveList`'s search box
- **THEN** matching changes are shown, in addition to the existing
  name-match and last-modified sort behavior

### Requirement: Changes and Archive lists show task-completion percentage and last-modified date

`ChangesList` and `ArchiveList` SHALL both display a task-completion
percentage alongside a change's `completedTasks`/`totalTasks` fraction,
computed from the same shared formatting function so the two never
diverge. A change with zero total tasks SHALL NOT display a percentage
(distinct from a change with a positive total and zero completed tasks,
which SHALL show "(0%)"). Both components SHALL display a change's
`lastModified` date when present.

#### Scenario: A change with completed and pending tasks

- **WHEN** `ChangesList` or `ArchiveList` renders a change with a
  positive `totalTasks`
- **THEN** the rendered progress includes both the fraction and a
  rounded percentage

#### Scenario: A change with no tasks at all

- **WHEN** a change's `totalTasks` is zero
- **THEN** the rendered progress shows the fraction only, with no
  percentage

#### Scenario: ChangesList shows last-modified date

- **WHEN** `ChangesList` renders a change with a `lastModified` value
- **THEN** that date is displayed, matching `ArchiveList`'s existing
  behavior
