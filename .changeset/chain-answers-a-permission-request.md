Fix a chain run hanging forever when its agent asks for permission: `HarnessChainRunner` now routes a `"resolvePermission"` command to the runner executing the stage in flight (mirroring how `"cancel"` is already routed), instead of rejecting it as a non-`"chain"` command. Both hosts (`packages/server`'s WebSocket dispatcher and the VS Code extension's webview message handler) gain the matching routing branch, and `HarnessChainPanel` gains the Allow/Deny control needed to answer. A permission request raised under `autonomyLevel: "autonomous"` — where there is no confirmation channel — now fails the stage with a stated reason and ends the underlying process, instead of waiting on a promise nothing can resolve.
