Added accounting plumbing for a run's resource usage and observed agent version, and an optional cost/token budget for Agentic Harness chains.

`AuditEntry` (security.ts) gains optional `usage`, `agentVersion`, and `changeDir` fields — all optional, so audit lines written before this change stay valid. `agent-detection.ts` now captures a best-effort agent version from the `--version` probe it already runs (no second spawn) via a new `detectAvailableAgentsDetailed()` export; the existing `detectAvailableAgents()` boolean-map contract is unchanged. New `agent-usage.ts` defines the adapter-agnostic `AgentUsage` shape; new `usage-report.ts` aggregates recorded usage by agent, by model, and by change, distinguishing unmeasured runs from zero cost. New `verified-agent-versions.ts` holds the single `claude` CLI version this project's structured-output parsing was verified against.

`HarnessConfig` gains an optional `budget` (`maxCostUsd`/`maxTokens`); `HarnessChainRunner` checks it before starting each stage of a chain and refuses to continue once recorded usage reaches it, naming the budget as the reason. A run already in progress is never interrupted. `WorkbenchProcess` gains an optional `usage` field so a run's recorded cost can be shown in the Processes view (extension tree, webui table) when present — never as `$0.00` when absent.

No adapter is changed by this commit: nothing yet produces `AuditEntry.usage`, so the budget stays inert until a future change (`acp-agent-adapters`) adds a producer.
