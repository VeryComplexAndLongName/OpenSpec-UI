# @openspec-ui/server

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a cross-host workspace lease (docs/adr/0010-cross-host-workspace-lease.md) so at most one host process — a VS Code extension or a standalone server, pointed at the same workspace — can run a mutating operation at a time. A blocked host gets an immediate, actionable error naming the other host instead of racing it or queuing forever. The standalone server's own `implement` execution is now routed through the same mutation lock and lease (it previously bypassed the scheduler entirely), closing a pre-existing same-host gap alongside the cross-host one.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @openspec-ui/core@0.30.0

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a downloadable sprint summary PDF report: for a user-picked date
  range and set of changes, who authored each one (from git), what it
  was, task completion, plus aggregate statistics (total changes, tasks
  completed in range, a per-author breakdown). New "Sprint report" mode
  in the standalone Timeline tab.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @openspec-ui/core@0.29.0

## 1.9.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a best-effort, git-derived change timeline data layer: created date,
  archived date, and a per-task completion date (via `git blame` on
  `tasks.md`, `null` for still-pending tasks), plus proposal/design/spec
  content in one read. New `getChangeTimeline`/`getChangeTimelines` in
  `@openspec-ui/core`, `POST /api/change-timeline`/`/api/change-timelines`
  in the standalone server, and a matching webui client. No UI yet — this
  is the shared data layer for a "change timeline" view, coming next.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @openspec-ui/core@0.27.0
