# @openspec-ui/webui

## 1.12.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a "Show Change Timeline" context-menu command (active and archived
  changes) and a standalone "Timeline" tab: proposal/design/spec content
  followed by tasks positioned by best-effort git-derived completion
  date, with pending/undated tasks shown distinctly. The extension
  computes the timeline directly (no HTTP, no message bridge) and opens
  it in a new webview tab per change.

## 1.11.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a best-effort, git-derived change timeline data layer: created date,
  archived date, and a per-task completion date (via `git blame` on
  `tasks.md`, `null` for still-pending tasks), plus proposal/design/spec
  content in one read. New `getChangeTimeline`/`getChangeTimelines` in
  `@openspec-ui/core`, `POST /api/change-timeline`/`/api/change-timelines`
  in the standalone server, and a matching webui client. No UI yet — this
  is the shared data layer for a "change timeline" view, coming next.

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies
  - @openspec-ui/core@0.27.0

## 1.10.0

### Minor Changes

- Notify when a `plan`/`implement`/`review` run finishes while you're not
  watching the Processes view or the AI panel. The VS Code extension shows a
  native notification (with a "View" action that opens the Process
  Dashboard); the standalone app shows a browser notification, once
  permission is granted. `status`/`list`/`show`/`validate` (near-instant) and
  `cancelled`/`interrupted`/`rolled-back` runs are not notified.
