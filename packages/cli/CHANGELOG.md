# @openspec-ui/cli

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a004d63: Add a `release-manifest` command that builds the `releases.json` the homepage reads.
  
  `OpenSpec-Ui-Homepage` currently reconstructs release information by walking this repository through the GitHub API, using a hard-coded map of `packages/<name>` paths that its own source calls "a bridge, not a destination" and that breaks silently on a monorepo reshuffle. The contract for the replacement already exists over there, in `app/schemas/manifest.py`; what was missing was a producer.
  
  `openspec-ui-cli release-manifest` builds that document from this repository's own records: each product's version from its `package.json`, its notes from the matching section of its `CHANGELOG.md`, and the extension's VSIX from the GitHub Release that already exists. Notes are trusted only when the changelog describes the version actually shipping, a changelog that does not parse yields no notes rather than a guess, and a product whose `package.json` cannot be read fails the build rather than being quietly omitted.
  
  `--fingerprint` prints the `id@version` set so CI can publish only when a version actually changed, and `--from` reads an already-published manifest so both sides of that comparison come from the same code.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Add `--help`/`-h` to `openspec-ui-cli`, printing usage (command syntax,
  options, exit codes) and exiting `0`. Usage is now also printed
  alongside argument-parsing and unknown-command errors, so a mistake
  surfaces the available options immediately instead of only an error
  message.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Package `@openspec-ui/cli` for npm distribution: bundle via esbuild
  (core's own source inlined, `cross-spawn`/`simple-git` kept as real
  dependencies), add a `bin` entry (`openspec-ui-cli`), and remove
  `"private": true`. The CLI's scope is unchanged — `validate` only. The
  actual `npm publish` is a separate manual step; this environment has no
  registry credentials.
