# @openspec-ui/cli

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 5b61c75: Make a failing merge gate say why. `openspec validate --json --strict` exits `1`
  to report an invalid change, printing the report on stdout; the wrapper rejected
  on any non-zero exit and kept only stderr, so every ordinary invalid change was
  reported as one that could not be validated — with the diagnosis that named the
  fix discarded, and `failedItems: 0, totalItems: 0` for the change that failed.
  
  `validateChange` now treats a non-zero exit carrying a readable report as the
  report. Where no report can be read, the reported reason prefers whichever
  stream carries a diagnosis and says "no diagnosis reported" rather than passing
  off a runtime warning banner as an explanation. The CLI's per-change result
  gains an `issues` field carrying what the underlying CLI stated. The exit-code
  contract is unchanged: `1` for a validation failure, `2` only where the check
  itself could not run.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- 9d4c55d: Describe what shipped. The CLI README said it "intentionally supports only
  `validate`" while the package had gained `change-graph` and
  `release-manifest`; all three are now documented. The extension README
  gains the Change Graph view, the command that walks a change back to what
  it follows, and the recorded spend and ceilings that were only described
  in LIMITS.md.

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- e6cf843: Point at the project site. Both manifests gain a `homepage`, so the
  Marketplace and npm listings link to https://openspec-ui.dev, and the
  READMEs a reader lands on say where it is.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- e78face: Read the relation between changes from core, and add a blocking one. The
  reader for `follows`/`supersedes` moves out of repository scripts and into
  `packages/core`, so the editor can use it in any workspace; `blocked_by`
  joins them, stating what must land before a change can start. The check
  that verifies them is a test rather than a lint script, so it runs with
  nothing built, and `openspec-ui-cli change-graph` renders the result.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- a004d63: Add a `release-manifest` command that builds the `releases.json` the homepage reads.
  
  `OpenSpec-Ui-Homepage` currently reconstructs release information by walking this repository through the GitHub API, using a hard-coded map of `packages/<name>` paths that its own source calls "a bridge, not a destination" and that breaks silently on a monorepo reshuffle. The contract for the replacement already exists over there, in `app/schemas/manifest.py`; what was missing was a producer.
  
  `openspec-ui-cli release-manifest` builds that document from this repository's own records: each product's version from its `package.json`, its notes from the matching section of its `CHANGELOG.md`, and the extension's VSIX from the GitHub Release that already exists. Notes are trusted only when the changelog describes the version actually shipping, a changelog that does not parse yields no notes rather than a guess, and a product whose `package.json` cannot be read fails the build rather than being quietly omitted.
  
  `--fingerprint` prints the `id@version` set so CI can publish only when a version actually changed, and `--from` reads an already-published manifest so both sides of that comparison come from the same code.

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Add `--help`/`-h` to `openspec-ui-cli`, printing usage (command syntax,
  options, exit codes) and exiting `0`. Usage is now also printed
  alongside argument-parsing and unknown-command errors, so a mistake
  surfaces the available options immediately instead of only an error
  message.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Package `@openspec-ui/cli` for npm distribution: bundle via esbuild
  (core's own source inlined, `cross-spawn`/`simple-git` kept as real
  dependencies), add a `bin` entry (`openspec-ui-cli`), and remove
  `"private": true`. The CLI's scope is unchanged — `validate` only. The
  actual `npm publish` is a separate manual step; this environment has no
  registry credentials.
